I don't always listen to podcasts, but when I do, I forget what I listed to... (and whether or not I should listen to more of it). This post aims to rectify that by keeping a running list of worthwhile podcasts.

(side note - recommendations are always welcome)

### The List

- [NPR Up First](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510318/up-first) - headlines of the day from NPR
- [Stuff You Should Know](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-stuff-you-should-know-26940277/) - deep dives into random topics
- [TED Talks Daily](https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/ted-talks/ted-talks-daily) - TED Talks, daily
- [The Habitat](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/the-habitat) - 7 episode series on "The true story of six volunteers picked to live on a fake planet."
