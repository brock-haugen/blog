# This site is now hosted via web3 :rocket:

To accomplish this:

1. haugen.io was registered via [domains.google](https://domains.google)
2. [fleek](https://fleek.co) is leveraged for deployments to [IPFS](https://ipfs.io)
3. brock.haugen.io was assigned as a custom domain (via CNAME record) in fleek

## tl;dr

fleek deployments upload all built files to IPFS and DNS resolves to the related IPNS hash
