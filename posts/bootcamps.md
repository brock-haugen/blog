Some thoughts:

- DRIs - no clear owner for decisions in group projects, etc
- Test driven development - no clear path to ensuring expected outcomes
- API contracts - particularly in full-stack group projects as a means of aligning on goals
- DB Migrations - just use Mongo already...
- General Project Setup - after the first little bit, cut the non-sense and provide a bootstrap
- Real world use cases - in tandem with above, provide _real_ projects to work on; focus on unique, IRL tasks vs re-inventing the wheel over and over
